**This is work in progress!**

The goal is to provide  centralized logging stack based on [Filebeat](https://www.elastic.co/products/beats/filebeat), [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch) and [Kibana](https://www.elastic.co/products/kibana).



## How to Start

The logging stack is located in the Imixs-Cloud management node. 

**This is work in progress!**
